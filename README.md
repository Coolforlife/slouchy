Slouchy uses your webcam to check if you're slouching and alert you if you are. This project is still in active development and not feature complete.

# Using - Linux
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Install PyQT4 and QT4 are installed: http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html

Tweak `slouchy.ini` to your liking.

Run `slouchy.py`

Sit upright in front of your webcam.

While sitting upright, right click on the Slouchy icon in your system tray and choose setup.

Slouchy will now alert you if you're slouching

If it complains about multiple faces run `main.py` and you should get an output image showing everything that looks like a face to the program. Remove anything from the background that looks like a face.
